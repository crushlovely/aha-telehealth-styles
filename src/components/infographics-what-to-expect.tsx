      <h2>
        During your visit, your doctor or another health care professional might
        ask questions about how you are feeling and if you use a health tracking
        device:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Breathing:</strong> Are you coughing or having trouble
          breathing?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chest and stomach:</strong> Do you feel pain or tenderness
          when touched?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ears, nose, mouth, throat:</strong> Any pain, sores or other
          problems?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Eyes:</strong> Do they look okay? Can you see clearly?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heart:</strong> What’s your pulse? Any chest pain or shortness
          of breath?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mental health:</strong> Have you noticed changes in your mood
          or memory?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Muscles and joints:</strong> Can you walk easily? Are your
          joints swollen? Do you feel sore?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neck:</strong> Do you have pain or trouble moving it?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nerves:</strong> Do you feel numbness or tingling?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Skin:</strong> Any rashes, sores or dry/cracked skin?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Your health care professional may also do a virtual exam and ask you to:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Stick out your tongue.</li>
        <li>Show the back of your throat.</li>
        <li>Point out a bump or rash.</li>
        <li>Move your neck or limbs to check for pain or stiffness.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Next, your health care professional may ask for:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Bloodwork</li>
        <li>An in-person follow-up appointment</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Be sure to ask:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What can I do to stay healthy?</li>
        <li>
          Will your office call me to set up my next visit, or should I call
          you?
        </li>
      </ul>
