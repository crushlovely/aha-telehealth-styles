              Your visit and messages are turned into unreadable code, so no one
              else can access them. Only you and your doctor can see and hear
              your visit.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Safety tip:</strong> Log out after your visit, and do not
              share your password with anyone.

              Telehealth services must follow HIPAA (Health Insurance
              Portability and Accountability Act) laws to keep your information
              private and safe. Your doctor cannot share your information
              without your consent, unless it is needed for safety or required
              by law.
            </p>
            <p>
              The doctor's notes from your visit, your test results, and
              messages are stored in secured portals that are password-protected
              for only you and your health care team to access.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Safety tip:</strong> Be sure to read and understand the
              consent (HIPAA) forms you sign, so you know what communication
              preferences you have chosen.

              Privacy for your telehealth appointment depends on where you have
              your visit. Good options may be a bedroom, a private outside porch
              or inside your parked car.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Safety tip:</strong> Before your telehealth visit, find a
              quiet, private place. Use earbuds or headphones.
